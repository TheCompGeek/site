Feel free to do whatever the fuck you want, provided you abide by the
included LICENSE.md file. This includes adding pages, squashing bugs, and
tiny improvements. It's all welcome here!

I encourage **all visitors** to submit a PR adding a line to

- `src/components/deets/greatings.txt` (Hi, Hello, Hola, etc) **or**
- `src/components/deets/isdoingstuffagain.txt` (Evan Boehs is (verb|adjective))

Be creative, everything is welcome (probably).
