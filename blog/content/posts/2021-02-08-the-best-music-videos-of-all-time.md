I am always blown away by the sheer level of creativity some artists not only put into their music but also into their music videos. in this post, I appreciate some specific music videos that stood out as special to me.

# Big Data - Dangerous

Honestly, I could write a whole post about this one, but Jeffrey Peters already did and did it much better than I ever could in this article. the song itself is a work of art, a tale of paranoia and surveillance in the digital age, but the music video takes it one step forward. the music video, although gory, is a protest regarding violence and over-sexualization in the media - and how it hence becomes normalized by our culture.

# Charli XCX - Boys

I debated about including this one, but I feel it is worthy. Charli managed to reel a bunch of big names in the music industry together and tie them up into a visually appealing music video to accompany her song. the lack of sexualization was also a bonus, giving the song a more romantic tone.
