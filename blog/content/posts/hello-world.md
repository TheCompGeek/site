Hello World. It's the one output every programmer has seen. Hello world is the mark of a new personal era. you might not think about it, but achieving the sentence in question requires work and dedication. those two tiny words often separate the winner from the quitter, the programmer from the programmer's mom. if you are here today, reading this post, it means I am not a quitter. I succeeded in what I set out to do, and I can't wait for what comes next.

Goodbye world.
