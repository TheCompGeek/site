Hello World. its the one output every programmer has seen. hello world is the mark of a new personal era. you might not think about it, but achiving the sentence in question requires work and dedication. those two tiny words often seperate the winner from the quitter, the programmer from the programmers mom. if you are here today, reading this post, it means I am not a quitter. I succeeded in what I set out to do, and I can't wait for what comes next.

Goodbye world.
