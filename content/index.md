# Hey!

I am ==Evan Boehs==, A developer working on projects across a large number of technologies including ==Rust==, ==Typescript==, and ==Python==. I have been solving problems with code since I was little, but of late have become much more active. My interesting projects can be found scattered around on my [GitHub](https://github.com/boehs), but I suggest you look at my [[]] for a more currated experience.

I thought here would be a good place to help you get to know me a bit better. I enjoy skiing a great deal, and a good portion of my year in Vermont.
