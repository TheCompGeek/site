I believe in details. I packed these details into [1.2 kB of HTML and 1.7 kB of CSS](/template):

- **The footer grass animation.** Have you tried it? It animates in and out smoothly based on cursor events.
- **Proper use of tags.** I use `html` and `meta` tags effectively based on extensive research.
- **CSS based theme switching.** As you would expect.
- **Javascript only when impossible without,** and even then good `noscript` fallbacks, users without javascript would never notice!
- **Near perfect lighthouse scores.**
- **some silly features:**
  - **Easily updatable `is` if not provided by the page like above.**
  - On the [home](/) page, there is a **randomized greeting.**
  - No framework crap being sent to your browser
- Connection with my **digital garden**

## Some other details

- I use **[uberspace](https://uberspace.de) for hosting.** This is a choice not based on speed nor price but on ethics.
  - Green energy powered
  - Small company
  - Treats everyone equally regardless of financials
  - Friendly to people of all skill levels
- My website is **built with ~~astro~~[11ty](https://11ty.dev)**.
