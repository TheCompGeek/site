I strive to provide useful and meaningful content to users of my site. In order to aid me with this goal, I collect small amounts of personally identifiable information. This information is retained for up to a 7 day period, {% comment %}before it is summerized and deleted. For transparency, this summerized data is avalible publicly.{% endcomment %}

## What is collected

Below is an [apache log configuration](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html).

```apacheconf
LogFormat %v:%^ %h %^[%d:%t %^] "%r" %s %b "%R" "%u"
```

If you are a human and you don't understand that nonsense, this means that each time you visit a page or otherwise make a request, the following data that could identify you is logged

- The first **two segments** of your **IP**
- The **time of your request**
- The **page visited**
- Your **user agent**
  - **Browser**
  - **OS**

In practice this looks like

```http
boehs.org:443 ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš«.ðŸš«ðŸš«.0.0 - - [24/Feb/2022:23:17:06 +0100] "GET /privacy HTTP/2.0" 200 746 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.137 Safari/537.36"
```

## How it's used

This data may be parsed into more data, including but not exclusively:

- Country (via IP)

{% comment %}
It is then represented as aggrate data by graphs publicly. This data is used to improve my services by understanding how they are used, as well as to be transparent.
{% endcomment %}
## Reselling

Your data is never sold, {% comment %}however aggrate data is public.{% endcomment %}

## Data retention

Specific data is stored for up to 7 days. {% comment %}It is than summerized via our logs parser (goaccess) and then the raw data is deleted.{% endcomment %}

## Requesting deletion

For any reason, you may request deletion of your data by emailing *webmaster boehs org*, however it is possible your data has already been deleted due to the retention policy described above.
