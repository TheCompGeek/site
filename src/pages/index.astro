    <p>I'm Evan, your run of the mill programmer, ski bum, photographer, and believer.</p>
    <p>I believe in <Wikilink href="/details">details</Wikilink>, that the little things make us whole.
    I believe that with hard work and love, anything is possible.
    For what it's worth, although we just met, I believe in you.</p>
